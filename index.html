             <p class="lizard">To all the students for fun!</p>
             There once was a programming wizard<br/>
             Who had a sharp pain in his gizzard<br/>
             But when he pressed keys<br/>
             His gas passed with easy<br/>
             And his programming stunk like dead lizard.<br/>

            <h2>Personal Interests</h2> 
            <p>I like to learn new thinks all the time. I will spend hours and hours until I can achieve what I want
            During the summer I was interesting in learn how to do renovation. So I learned about construction, painting,
            plammer and Electricity. I finished remodeled all my house. From the baseman to every room in the house.</p>
            <p>I love music. So, I am trying to learn to play every instrument. When I was a teen a went to a music school;
            but, when I needed to start college my parent did not let me keep with my classes. And have a major in music 
            was not and option; so, I went to Medical school to be a doctor. In USA I am a EMT.</p>
            <p>I love learn other lenguages. When I have time I watch a ot of dramas from different countries. From Korea, 
            Japones, Hindi, Brazil, Italy, etc. When I finished school I am planning to learn as many languages that I can.
            Right now I am fluent in spanish and english. I understand portugues and italian; but, I forgot a many word.
            So, my portugues in italian are pretty rustin. However, One day I will be able to speak flently that two languas
            and speak many others. So, when I go to visit this country I will be able to speak with the native people without
            has someone to traslate for me.</p>
